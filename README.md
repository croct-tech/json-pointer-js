## Introduction

This library provides an [RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) compliant JSON pointer implementation
to handle and manipulate arbitrary JSON values with type-safety.

## Installation

We recommend using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the package:

```sh
npm install @croct-tech/json-pointer
```

## Overview

This library ships with a fast implementation of the JSON Pointer specification, as described in 
[RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).

These are the main highlight that distinguishes it from similar libraries:

- Fast and lightweight, zero dependencies
- Fully compliant with the specification, including validation, serialization, and deserialization
- Provide methods for reading and writing structures
- Restricts operations such that no array becomes sparse
- Ensures that a valid `JsonStructure` modified by a `JsonPointer` results in a still valid `JsonStructure`

## Contributing

Contributions to the package are always welcome! 

- Report any bugs or issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/croct-tech/json-pointer-js/issues).
- For major changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/croct-tech/json-pointer-js/issues) first to discuss what you would like to change.
- Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Testing

```sh
npm install
```

Then, to run all tests:
