## Introduction

This library provides a fast, [RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) compliant 
JSON pointer implementation to manipulate arbitrary JSON values with type-safety.
[Relative JSON pointers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-relative-json-pointer-00) 
are also supported.

These are the main highlight that distinguishes it from similar libraries:

- Fast and lightweight, zero dependencies
- Fully compliant with the specification, including validation, serialization, and deserialization
- Provide methods for reading and writing structures
- Restricts operations such that no array becomes sparse
- Ensures that a valid `JsonStructure` modified by a `JsonPointer` results in a still valid `JsonStructure`

## Installation
