            👋 @{{ author }}
            
            **Thanks for your contribution!**
            
            The approval and merge process is almost fully automated 🧙
            
            Here's how it works:
            
            1. You open a new pull request
            2. Automated tests check the code
            3. Maintainers review the code
            4. Once approved, the PR is manually tagged as `ready for merge`
            5. Commits are squashed and automatically merged into the target branch
            
            ☝️ Lastly, the title for the commit will come from the pull request title. So please provide a descriptive title that summarizes the changes in **50 characters or less using the imperative mood.**
            
            Happy coding! 🎉
